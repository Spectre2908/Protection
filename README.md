IM AM NOT HERE PROMOTING ANY OF THESE COMPANIES, I AM HERE TO HELP YOU WITH INTERNET AND COMPUTER SECURITY WITH THE THINGS I USE!

Our computer security is something we all need to consider a lot more than most people do.
These are some programs that might help.

1.Program created by an Unknown user, I used his/her code to create a cheap and crappy encyrption/decryption program for Windows.
This is basically so if someone on the outside world gets into your account, and they have no algorithm or cryptonitcs experiance,
then they cannot read your messages without the decryption program. This is not something to keep the Government out, just a small program
to protect your secrets :P
2.Random Password Generator, made by the IObit company, this generates a random password to the settings you set it to. Some examples of
12 letter passwords I created are...EAWWWRRR6n+I, yuppplll4H*#, avllll++4I((, etc. There are thousands of different passwords.
This is the MOST effective Random Password Generator I know.
3.IObit Advanced System Care, IObit Anti-Malware, Driver Booster 3, etc. All on the IObit website. These programs are trusted and many
people use them as anti virus, anti malware, and computer system care programs, and also a defrag program. All used to make your
computer better protected and faster.
4.Dashlane, this program is really interesting, it holds passwords and almost anything I can think of. Hell even copies of your Personal i
info, Payment methods like credit card, and paypal. Also ID's or passports. Hell even receipts. Obviously I wouldnt put ANY Of my personal
info on this prgoram, but I prefer to use the password saver, and email saver. 

Dashlane is life-changingly great. And free. Get it.
